Bubble Sort:
* In-place
* Stable
* O(n^2) - Algorithm degrades quickly

Selection Sort:
* In-place 
* Unstable 
* O(n^2)

Insertion Sort:
* In-place 
* Stable 
* O(n^2) 

Shell Sort:
* In-place 
* Unstable 
* O(n^2) - but can perform better than that

Merge Sort:
* Not In-place
* Stable
* O(nlog(n)) - base 2 - Repeated dividing of the array into half during the splitting phase
